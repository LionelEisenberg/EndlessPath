Endless Path Game Design Document [v0.1]
Version: 0.1 (Initial Draft)
Date: October 26, 2025
Design Goals
* Create an engaging idle/incremental game with active mini-game elements.
* Thematically immerse the player in a Wuxia cultivation setting inspired by the Cradle series.
* Employ a layered game design, introducing new mechanics sequentially like Unnamed Space Idle, where each layer interacts with and builds upon previous ones.
* Provide satisfying short-term active gameplay loops (mini-games) and long-term passive progression (cultivation advancement).
* Focus on a single-player experience with a clear sense of progression and power scaling.
Core Concept


Endless Path is an incremental idle game blended with active mini-games, simulating the journey of a sacred artist cultivating their power. Players start at the Foundation stage, engaging in a "Cycling" mini-game to generate Madra and increase Core Density. As they advance through cultivation stages (Copper, Iron, Jade, etc.), they unlock new, distinct gameplay systems represented as tabs: Scripting (creating short-term buffs via calligraphy), Elixir Making (creating long-term buffs via potion crafting), Adventuring (exploring node-based maps and engaging in real-time combat for resources), and Soulsmithing (crafting gear via assembly puzzles). Each system feeds into the others, creating interconnected loops that drive overall progression. The game features a world map for exploration and resource gathering (Foraging), adding another layer to the core loop.
Genre
* Primary: Incremental / Idle Game
* Secondary: Mini-game Collection, Simulation (Cultivation), Light RPG (Combat/Gear)
Target Platform
* Initial: PC (Windows, Mac, Linux via Godot export), potentially Web build
* Focus: Itch.io / Steam release
Core Gameplay Loop


The core loop evolves as new systems unlock:
1. Foundation Stage:
   * Forage (Idle Action on Map) -> Gather Tier 0 Resources (Herbs, Stone, Paper).
   * Cycle (Active Mini-game) -> Generate Madra & Core Density XP.
   * Spend Madra & Reach Core Density Threshold -> Breakthrough.
2. Copper Stage:
   * (Foundation Loop continues)
   * Use Tier 0 Resources + Madra in Scripting (Active Mini-game) -> Create short-term Buffs.
   * Use Tier 0 Resources + Madra in Elixir Making (Active Mini-game) -> Create long-term Buffs.
   * (Progression toward Iron)
3. Iron Stage:
   * (Copper Loop continues)
   * Use Buffs + Engage in Adventuring (Node-based exploration + Real-time Combat) -> Gather Sacred Resources (Remnants, Parts) & Manuals (Scripts, Recipes, Schematics).
   * Use Tier 0 + Sacred Resources + Madra in Soulsmithing (Active Mini-game) -> Create Gear & Trinkets.
   * Gear improves Adventuring and potentially other systems.
   * (Progression toward Jade)
4. Repeat & Scale: Use outputs from later systems to enhance earlier ones (e.g., Gear boosts Cycling, Scripts boost Adventuring), driving advancement and unlocking new Map Zones and higher tiers of all activities.
Key Mechanics
* Cultivation Progression:
   * Madra: Primary spendable currency, generated mainly by Cycling. Used for crafting, scripting, advancement costs.
   * Core Density: Stage-specific level (0-100), increased via Cycling mini-game clicks. Reaching 100% enables a Breakthrough attempt.
   * Breakthrough: Requires meeting Madra/Density thresholds and completing a "Tribulation" mini-game.
   * Tribulation Mini-game: An intense, pathless Cycling challenge. The player must follow a randomly-moving Madra-orb with their mouse with high accuracy for a set time, or they fail the breakthrough.
* Map System:
   * A 3D Hex-grid planet view. Clicking a hex (Zone) opens a side panel.
   * Zone Panel: Displays info, allows interaction via buttons ([Forage], [Adventure Location], [Merchant], [Story]).
   * Zone Unlocks: Gated by defeating Zone Bosses, which require specific cultivation stages.
* Foraging:
   * An idle action toggled via a single [Toggle Foraging ON/OFF] button in the Zone Panel.
   * Passively generates Tier 0 crafting resources (Herbs, Stone, Paper) over time at a small, continuous Madra cost. Zone determines available resources.
* Cycling:
   * An active 2-part mini-game on a body diagram:
   * Mouse-Following: Following a Path2D generates Madra.
   * Rhythm-Clicks: Clicking "inflection points" at the right time generates Core Density XP.
   * Different "Cycling Techniques" (unlocked later) will change the path and rewards.
* Scripting:
   * Active mini-game: "Calligraphy" - trace characters with the mouse.
   * Skill: Stroke order and accuracy determine the script's quality (e.g., Basic, Quality, Pristine), affecting its power or duration.
   * Requires Paper, Ink (from Foraging) + Madra.
   * Produces consumable Scripts for short-duration, stackable buffs (e.g., Auto-Cycle Script).
* Elixir Making:
   * Active mini-game: Multi-stage crafting process with stations like [Purification] (rapid-click), [Power Infusion] (mouse-follow), and [Stabilization] (timed-click).
   * Requires Herbs/Ingredients (from Foraging/Adventuring) + Madra.
   * Produces consumable Elixirs for long-duration buffs (e.g., +10% Core Density XP).
* Adventuring:
   * Unlocked at Iron stage (along with the Iron Body tree).
   * Exploration: A node-based grid map (Poke Rogue style) where the player can move freely (up/down/left/right) to revealed nodes.
   * Node Types: [Combat], [Elite Combat], [Treasure Chest], [Final Boss], and [Madra Well].
   * Provides Sacred Resources (Remnants, Beast Parts) and Manuals/Recipes/Schematics.
* Combat:
   * Real-time system inspired by Biotomata. Fixed HP and regenerating AP (Ability Point) pools.
   * No basic attack.
   * A "Cycle" skill (Tap, 0-cost): For 5s, AP regenerates quickly, but all other skills are disabled.
   * Players use learned Sacred Techniques (cost AP, have cooldowns).
   * Starter Skills:
      1. [Flowing Strike]: Low AP cost, Low Cooldown. Reliable, low-damage attack.
      2. [Stand your Ground]: Medium AP cost. A 10-second defensive buff.
      3. [Empty Palm]: High AP cost, High Cooldown. High damage, and increases enemy cooldowns by 1.5s.
   * New skills are unlocked via the Iron Body Tree and Main Advancement Tree.
* Soulsmithing:
   * Unlocked at Iron.
   * Active mini-game: "The Assembly Puzzle." The player fits abstract, colored, Tetris-like "Remnant Part" shapes into a "Schematic" grid.
   * Complexity will increase (e.g., color-coding, harder shapes) at higher tiers.
   * Requires Stone (Foraging) + Sacred Resources (Adventuring) + Madra.
   * Produces Gear (Weapons/Armor) and Trinkets (Rings/Amulets) that provide stats for Adventuring and bonuses for other systems (e.g., Parasite Ring for Cycling).
* Resources:
   * Tier 0: Basic Herbs, Stone, Paper, Ink (from Foraging).
   * Sacred: Remnants, Beast Parts (from Adventuring).
   * Knowledge: Manuals, Recipes, Schematics (from Adventuring, Merchants, Advancement).
   * Fame: Secondary resource from Adventuring (potential future use for Sects/high-level advancement).
Visual Style
* Overall: Cartoonish Pixel Art, similar aesthetic to Fusion Forge.
* UI: Clean, tab-based interface. The Map view will feature a 3D hex planet. Zone interactions via a 2D side panel.
* Gameplay:
   * Cycling: Body outline with Madra paths.
   * Scripting: Tracing glowing characters on parchment.
   * Elixir Making: 2D stations with ingredients/tools.
   * Adventuring: Node-based map; simple combat UI (HP/AP bars, skill icons).
   * Soulsmithing: Schematic grid with abstract Tetris-like pieces.
   * Cultivation stage visually represented (e.g., badges/auras).
Audio Design
* Music: Thematic background track.
* SFX: Need distinct sounds for:
   * Cycling (following, clicking, perfect click)
   * Mini-game success/failure (Scripting, Elixirs, Soulsmithing)
   * Combat (Skill usage, hits, enemy defeat, AP regen)
   * UI Interactions (Button clicks, tab switching)
   * Resource Gain (Foraging ticks, collecting items)
   * Breakthrough/Tribulation (success/failure, charging)
* Priority: Lower priority for MVP, but essential SFX for core actions should be included eventually.
Technology
* Engine: Godot Engine (latest stable version, e.g., 4.x)
* Language: GDScript
MVP Goals
* Implement Core Systems up to the Iron stage:
   * Foundation: Map (1 zone), Foraging (idle, 1 action), Cycling (mini-game), Core Density/Madra tracking, Breakthrough/Tribulation mechanic (v1).
   * Copper: Scripting (mini-game, 1-2 basic scripts like Auto-Cycle), Elixir Making (mini-game, 1-2 basic elixirs).
   * Iron: Adventuring (1 location, node map, basic combat with 3 starting skills), Iron Body Tree (basic passives/skill unlocks), Soulsmithing (mini-game, 1-2 basic gear schematics).
* Functional UI: Tabs for each system, basic Map interface, resource displays.
* Core Progression: Ability to advance from Foundation to Iron.
* Basic placeholder visuals and SFX sufficient for testing the loop.
Future Ideas / Stretch Goals
* Jade Stage & Beyond: Introduce Paths (typed Madra affecting abilities/crafting), more complex Zones/Adventures, advanced Soulsmithing/Elixir recipes (e.g., color-coded pieces), Sage/Herald mechanics.
* Automation: Introduce higher-level Scripts or mechanics to automate Elixir Making, Soulsmithing, and potentially parts of Adventuring, following the Unnamed Space Idle philosophy.
* Sect System: Allow players to build/manage a sect, potentially recruiting disciples (tying into the "Fame" resource).
* Prestige Layers: Implement Disciple Takeover (1st layer, based on Core level) and Ascension (2nd layer) mechanics.
* Narrative: Develop the story elements introduced in Foundation.
* Polish: Enhanced VFX, SFX, UI polish, tutorials.
